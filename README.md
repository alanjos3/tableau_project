# 🛫 Domestic Flight Pattern Analysis in India using Tableau

This project analyzes over 300,000 records of domestic flight data between India's five major metro cities: Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, and Kolkata. Built with Tableau, this visualization-based study explores pricing trends, route popularity, seasonal patterns, and airline performance from both customer and stakeholder perspectives.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- 📉 Booking 30+ days in advance leads to ~25% cost savings.
- 🧳 Delhi-Mumbai is the busiest and most profitable route.
- ✈️ Vistara and Air India dominate in premium class profitability.
- 🔁 Direct flights cost ~15% more than connecting ones.
